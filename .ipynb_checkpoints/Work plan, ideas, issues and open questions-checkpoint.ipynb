For all of these users, all of the features that refer to this time window (e.g., Last_30D_Revenue_Net or Last_90D_Gross_Sink) have, by definition, zero value (as zero logins means zero revenue or sink).

    "## Comments from \"Exploratory Data Analysis of the historical features - Part 1\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Selecting features by their entropy**: \n",
    "    - The entorpy of many of the features is very low. For example, the 'is_vip' feature -> almost all of the users are not VIP. \n",
    "    - Other such features are 'is_elite', and the revenue features (in the last 30 days, ca. 94% of the users have zero revenue in that time period). \n",
    "    - Such features most probably doesn't contribute to the segmentation, and so they should be ignored (but see pt.3 below). \n",
    "    - That is, if all features had a uniform distribution (maximal entropy) over the users, it would have been easier to segment the users into evenly sized seperate groups. However, with the distributions of the users for almost all the features being highly skewed (e.g., very few users at the high level brackets, with the vast majority of the users at the lower brackets), it is not clear how to reach a segmentation beyond the trivial clusters determined by the features distributions. \n",
    "    - This is especially the case, as many of the features are highly correlated, or at least highly related: vip users are also those with the higher revenues and at the higher level brackets, practically by definition. \n",
    "    - <font color='red'>Such feature selection implicitly takes place when performing dimensionality reduction on the feature space, like with **PCA** (**any other approach?**). So performing PCA and then choosing only the few most significant principles components will filter out the less informative features.</font> \n",
    "    - <font color='red'>Still to check: how long does it takes to do PCA on a 5x10^6 x 20 feature table, and if it takes very long, find approximate solution -> perform the PCA on a smaller data set, or simply drop features with low entropy (like the 'is_vip' feature).</font>    \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Obvious segments without even clustering or any other techniques**: \n",
    "    - Some of the features that has very low entropy create immidate segments. For example, if the target function is revenue, then the VIP users, although relatively very few from the overall population, represent a segment of their own. \n",
    "    - This is of course trivial -> most probably a user recieves the VIP status because of high frequency of deposits -> this can greatly simplify the segmentation step in many cases. As in, after the trivial segments are built, other segments can be estimated from clusters on raw data that doesn't include these trivial features.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Segmentation with the target KPI in mind**: \n",
    "    - If the target KPI is **revenue**, then there are several issues that stems from that this is a **very sparse KPI**. \n",
    "    - That is, most of the users in the data-set has zero past revenue, and will have zero revenue in the future. \n",
    "    - In addition, there are very few features, if at all, that provide a good prediction to whether a user will make future deposits (as obvious from that in the LTV project no model exist for predicting the future revenue at the user level, and no such model exist for active users). \n",
    "    - So most possible the best segmentation in this case of revenue as the KPI (especially if it has a short horizon of a few days), is to take the naive segmentation of two groups: the first, is of \"all users that deposited in the past\", and the second is \"all users that had no past deposits\". The first (much smaller) segment could be further segmented into smaller groups. \n",
    "    - In addition, it is predicted that adding features (that are not revenue related) to the segmentation would only reduce the homogeniety of the segments. \n",
    "    - Thus, this is a clear case of an obvious feature-set to consider for the segmentation for a specific target KPI, if the homogeneity is to be optimized. Any other more sophisticated algorithm will most probably fail. <font color='red'>**And so the question is: what is the view of the product/studio for such a case?**</font>\n",
    "    - to check: most probably running a CatBoost on the overall raw past feature set will result with the revenue features being the most important ones to predict future revenue, in-line with using such a model as a general solution for the task at hand.   \n",
